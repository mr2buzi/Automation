- Task is to use a python script to go through all the folder names and check / list the ones starting
  with ut_ (these are the only files which we are interested in or which would be found useful). Then
  go into folders listed (starting with _ut) one by one. In each of these folders, look for files with 
  a .thr extension and copy the content into another file named combined_report_date.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- There should be a file called combined_result_date with all of the data fromthe .thr files from folders
  with ut), e.g. if there are 5 .thr files we should have all of their data concentrated in combined_result_date.
